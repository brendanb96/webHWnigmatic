The Star Path
by Brendan Boursiquot


I have not known the air to be so pale,
Empty and dull, when I breathe
It does not tint the red that beats inside me
Nor the brown that lines my flesh


For I have known a world so bold and blue,
Where I remained, so still and pink.
Each moment, each forever, prevailing
And I did nothing more than endure


But these words are nothing more than a melody
For there is a little red that beats inside me
And a little brown that swings my soul
I do not need to be bold and blue,
For deep inside I am still and I am pink
With every breath, if I am not colored in the world’s hues
Then I have done more than endure, I have prevailed
