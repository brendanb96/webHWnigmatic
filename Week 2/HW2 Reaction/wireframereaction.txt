Reaction to "Five Important Considerations for Wireframing"

After reading this article, I feel that the common thread between 
all the "five important considerations" is communication and
teamwork. I have not worked in a such a layered and professional
setting in which is described in the article; however, I KNOW
that even on an amateur level there has to be a high amount of 
transparency, whether that's between one other person, four other
people, or even yourself. No matter the "level" of the project
or the number of team members, there are steps that need to be
followed (there's levels to this...) so that when one aspect of
the project is being worked, information from other aspects or parts
can be easily obtained. This makes everyting much more efficient.
